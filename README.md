# AIForMedicine-Specialization
Coursera's AI For Medicine Specialization Coursework

[Course Link](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ai-for-medicine)

The solution to weekly challenges are my own work. You should **never** submit the work in this repository as your own work to pass the course. This repository is for learning purpose only. Solutions provided in this repository are my attempt to come up with my own ideas to solve the challenges posed throughout the course. One is more than welcome to explore my solutions and benefit from the new ideas if any.

If you benefitted from this repo, please consider showing your appreciation [here](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/ey0XpgZ) :)

Any ideas to improve this repository or include your own work in this repository is appreciated. I can be best reached at @Sushil in the course's slack. Feel free to drop a message or at least say 'Hi'.

Star this page to follow my updates.
Thank you.
